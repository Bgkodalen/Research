Many of the terms used in this summary will be defined below. My research at WPI focuses on association schemes, mainly those that are $Q$-polynomial. For instance, one focus is on 3-class $Q$-antipodal association schemes known as linked systems of symmetric designs (LSSDs). Previously, it was known that these objects were equivalent to certain Mutually Unbiased Bases (MUBs) and many examples were built whenever a specific parameter was a power of two. In a paper recently accepted for publication by Algebraic Combinatorics, I have classified exactly when this connection can be drawn between LSSDs and MUBs as well as introduced new geometric objects called ``Linked simplices" which are equivalent to LSSDs in general. I then use this connection to build an infinite families of new examples which correspond to MUBs without requiring the power of two restriction which was seen previously. These constructions use not only original work, but also ties in various other constructions such as MacNeish's construction for orthogonal arrays, Muzychuk and Xiang's construction for Hadamard matrices, and Wocjan and Beth's construction for MUBs. The paper finishes by classifying those families of symmetric designs which could produce non-trivial LSSDs. Out of the 21 known families of symmetric designs, I have shown that ten of these families will never produce large ($w>2$) LSSDs and another 6 families can only produce large LSSDs in very restricted cases. I have presented on this work both at the CMS Winter meeting in Canada as well as the AMS sectional meeting in Ohio this year.\par

Another project was to extend a result for metric association schemes to the general case. In metric schemes, any connected basis relation is $k$-connected where $k$ is the valency. A long standing conjecture of Brouwer is that this holds for any connected basis relation in any symmetric association scheme. As a step towards proving this conjecture, in joint work I have proven that any proper subset of the neighborhood of any vertex will not serve as a disconnecting set. More generally, I have shown that deleting any vertex and its neighborhood leaves behind at most one non-trivial component. The remaining trivial components only occur in certain imprimitive association schemes. This work then explores the various implications of this result including showing that 2-connected basis relations must have $k=2$. The results of this project were published in the Electronic Journal of Combinatorics and presented at the Ninth Discrete Geometry and Algebraic Combinatorics Conference in Texas last May.\par

My most recent work has been focused on $Q$-polynomial schemes with low class number ($3$, $4$, and $5$). Through joint work with Dr. Wei-Hsuan Yu, I discovered that a semi-definate programming bound given for spherical codes in 1977 can rule out certain association schemes. After transfering this into the language of association schemes, this technique ruled out eleven 3-class and nine 4-class association schemes from a list of open parameter sets given by Dr. Williford.\par

The significance of the research outlined above lies in our understanding of certain association schemes which serve as a framework for the study of problems in other areas. Mutually unbiased bases, for example, are desired by quantum physicists in order to help study quantum states. These can be used both for efficient quantum measurements as well as constructing an unbreakable cryptographic scheme. While this application only requires our vectors to be complex, understanding real MUBs further can assist our search for their complex counterparts. Beyond this, the real analogue of the MUB problem is interesting in its own right; these give us special types of 4-class association schemes. This further motivates us to understand and build non-trivial examples of LSDs in order to arrive at more examples of MUBs. Currently, building a single example of an LSD with more than two fibers with other than Menon parameters is an open problem.\par
In each problem, we always seek to understand the basic examples as well as the general structure of the object in question. While the known examples tend to have structure imposed on them, we often are able to derive some information which can be generalized to other cases. An example of such an approach is when we study LSDs on 16 points (which are well known) in an attempt to build LSDs on 36 or 45 points, the existence of which, remarkably, remains an open problem. In the case of 16 points, the natural point set is $\mathbb{Z}_2^4$. With this coordinatization, the blocks of the main design correspond to cosets of the symmetric difference of two planes. However, the only difference set with $v=45$ occurs inside $\mathbb{Z}_{15}\times\mathbb{Z}_3$; it is no longer possible to describe geometric objects such as ``planes" with such ease but the concept of an ``oval" can be abstracted to this less structured case.\par
While the search for examples is important, it is also important to continue building a theory that sheds light on these examples. For example, both LSDs and MUBs are cometric association schemes. We therefore seek to understand the different types of cometric association schemes further. Using only the fact that intersection numbers must be integral, we show that there are only 11 (non-trivial) feasible parameter sets for LSDs with less than 200 points. We can also use the non-negativity of the Krein parameters to find bounds on the number of fibers for each parameter set. In this way our project not only involves a search for examples but also the development of a theory which proves non-existence in some cases and reveals structure in others.\par
A \textit{(symmetric) association scheme} is an edge-coloring of the complete graph (with loops all colored the same) with the added property that the vector space spanned by the corresponding adjacency matrices is closed under standard matrix multiplication and entry-wise product. By diagonalizing the basis matrices, we form a second basis of primitive idempotents, one for each eigenspace. A metric (co-metric) association scheme is one in which the adjacency (idempotent) matrices can be ordered in such a way that the $i^\text{th}$ matrix is representable as a polynomial of the first matrix with degree $i$ under standard (entry-wise) multiplication. A \textit{symmetric design} is a point-block incidence structure with $v$ points and $v$ blocks where every block contains $k$ points and every pair of points occurs in $\lambda$ blocks. For example any finite projective geometry is a symmetric design. A \textit{linked system of symmetric designs} is a graph with $w$ fibers where the adjacency structure between any two fibers is the incidence structure of a symmetric design and these pairwise incidence relations are ``consistent", in a sense, when looking at triples of fibers. A set of $k$ \textit{mutually unbiased bases} is a collection of $k$ unitary bases for $\mathbb{C}^d$ where the inner product of any pair of vectors from distinct bases has modulus $\frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}$ In summary, I use tools from areas such as graph theory, group theory, and linear algebra in order to further applications in coding theory, experimental designs, and quantum information theory.\par
While carrying out this research, I have also served as a TA each term with assignments including managing the Stratton Tutoring Center, helping organize teaching teams, working with and observing PLAs who are struggling with conferences, organizing my own conferences, and assisting professors with online courses. I also taught my own section of Discrete Mathematics over the summer. I have presented in the Discrete Seminar and traveled to Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology to give a research presentation as a recruitment event for WPI. As mentioned, I am presenting at a conference in Texas this May and have been invited to present at a conference in August provided this does not conflict with my summer research program with the NSA.
