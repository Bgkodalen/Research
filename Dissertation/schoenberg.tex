\chapter{Sch\"{o}nberg's Theorem}
Let $m$ be a fixed positive integer. Sch\"{o}nberg's Theorem \cite{Schoenberg1942} tells us that a continuous function $f:[-1,1]\rightarrow \re$ is positive definite if and only if $f$ is expressible as a non-negative linear combination of the Gegenbauer polynomials.
