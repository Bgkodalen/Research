\chapter{Positive semi-definite cone of an association scheme}\label{psdcone}
Consider the following classic unsolved problem in Euclidean geometry (\cite{Haantjes1948},\cite{vanLint1966},\cite{Lemmens1973}): Given a fixed positive integer $n$, what is the maximum number of lines through the origin one may find in $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that the angle between any pair of distinct lines is $\theta$. Much progress has been made on this topic, (I know this is a major skip... I'll come back to this if we decide to keep it) including bounds arising from linear programming semi-definite programming (\cite{Barg2014}). An equivalent question is as follows: for a fixed positive integer $n$, what is the largest positive semi-definite matrix with rank $n$ which contains only the entries $1,\pm\cos(\theta)$.
