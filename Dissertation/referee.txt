Page 3 Line 1, I suggest changing "Relabel the symbols of the OA" to "Relabel the symbols of each column of the OA" 
	only to draw attention that the relabeling will (likely) be different for each column.
Page 4 Proof of Thm2.2, First reorder the rows so that the last m rows are repeated, else the relabeling is not possible.
Page 5 Between Example 1 and Example 2, I suggest aligning the verbage "that is repeated more than ____" and "that is repeated ___ times" for consistency.
Page 7 Equation (3), I suggest swapping the order on the left or using parenthesis so that the reader knows to not sum multiple copies of lambda G_j.
	i.e. Make it clear that the equation does NOT state Sum_{i:x\in B_i}(B_i+\lambda G_j)=...

Comment:
Page 9 End of Section 3.4 If you assume the first m rows of each vector are the same (without loss of generality all came from the symbol 0) then it is clear
	that you may subtract m-1 from the RHS of 1+k(n-1)<=N to get the inequality m+k(n-1)<=N as you found in section 3.2. I find it interesting that these
	two techniques give you the same obvious bound in the case of m-repeated rows, though I agree that the extension to get Theorem 2.2 as a result is not obvious.
	It might be worth mentioning this small extension only because you mention the same in 3.2, though I am happy either way.
